The solution depends on the specific native module involved.  Generally, you'll need to follow the instructions provided by the module's author for linking the native code into your React Native project. This often involves:

1. **For Android:**  Making sure the necessary configurations are in your `android/app/build.gradle` and potentially modifying your `settings.gradle`.  You might need to run `./gradlew clean` and rebuild your app.
2. **For iOS:**  Ensuring that the native code is properly integrated into your Xcode project (via Cocoapods or manual linking, as described in the module's instructions). You might need to clean the project in Xcode and rebuild.
3. **Checking Package Installation:** Verify that the package is properly installed and linked through npm or yarn. Reinstall it if necessary.

Example (Illustrative):

//bug.js
import Camera from 'react-native-camera'; // Assuming this isn't properly linked

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Camera />;
};

// bugSolution.js
// After proper linking (following the `react-native-camera` instructions):
import Camera from 'react-native-camera';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }}/>;
};
